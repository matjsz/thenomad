<p align="center"><strong>The Nomad</strong> is stil a Work in Progress, but it will be soon available. All I can say is that it's a blog, and... that's all.</p>

<br><br>

<h2>Some new updates! :)</h2>

<p><strong>The website won't be available until I buy a server for it, so this repository will stay just as a backup for the project, but soon it will be 100% available :)</strong></p>
<p>The main pages are done, they include the home page and the story page.</p>
<p>I didn't upload the project files yet because it has some API keys and data that I still need to mask, but I will do it soon.</p>

<p>I'll keep uptading things here, but the blog is pretty close to the launching date so... the release will talk by itself.</p>
