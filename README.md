<p align="center"><a href="https://thenomadofficial.vercel.app">The Nomad</a> is my personal blog, a place where I share my ideas and some of my monologues from time to time.</p>

<br><br>

<h2>Final update! :)</h2>

<p>I'm really happy to say that the blog is finished completely. <a href="https://thenomadofficial.vercel.app">See it here</a></p>
<p>The blog source code is availabe in this repository, some things like API keys and IDs were replaced and some parts of the code are not present to ensure data security, but the rest is there.</p>
